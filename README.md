# IVV24 – Bias Detection in News Articles

This repository contains the code and materials for the short paper project **"Bias Detection in News Articles"**, conducted as part of the IVV 2024 seminar at the University of Regensburg.

## 🧠 Project Description

This study investigates individuals’ ability to detect media bias in journalistic texts and evaluates the effectiveness of different support strategies:

- 🛠️ **BiasScanner-assisted group**
- 📘 **Definition-based support group**
- ❌ **Control group (no support)**

Participants completed classification tasks and their performance was measured across two phases. Key performance metrics included **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

The goal was to examine whether tool-based or conceptual support improves bias detection, and whether a learning effect occurs.

## 📊 Key Findings

- Tool-supported participants performed with high precision during the support phase but showed dependency.
- The control group outperformed the definition group in Phase 2.
- A small sample size (N=20) limits generalizability, but trends are evident
